import time
"""
Reports the status of image processing jobs by publishing statistics to Redis.

Description of keys:

We want to know what proportion of requests failed over several time intervals.
These are tracked through window functions:
status60s:{domain} - Events that occurred in the last 60 seconds
status1hr:{domain} - Events that occurred in the last hour
status12hr:{domain} - Events that occurred in the last 12 hours
statuslast50req:{domain} - The last 50 events over any time interval.

We also want to know the overall progress of the crawl and have a general
idea of which domains are having problems:
resize_errors - Number of errors that have occurred across all domains
resize_errors:{domain} - Number of errors that have occurred for a domain
num_resized - Number of successfully resized images
num_resized:{domain} - Number of successfully resized images for a domain

Domains are formatted as the TLD and suffix.
Valid example: status60s:staticflickr.com
Invalid example: status60s:https://staticflickr.com
